# Project Overview:
Palm leaf manuscripts are one of the oldest and most significant sources of knowledge, and their preservation has been a challenging task for centuries. These manuscripts are made up of dried palm leaves, and they contain important historical and cultural information, such as religious texts, literature, and scientific knowledge. Digitizing these manuscripts has become a necessary task to preserve this valuable knowledge for future generations.<br>
The recognition of handwritten characters in palm leaf manuscripts is a complex task due to the variations in text styles and the irregularities in the characters. To address this problem, we propose a system for palm leaf letter detection and recognition using CRAFT and VGGNet techniques.
